Since the policy was trained to optimize for PM score, it should produce responses that are\\non the upper end of the score distribution.\\n• We mix the new comparison data with our existing data, and train a new scan of PMs, which we\\nthen use to train a new scan of RLHF policies. Then reiterate this process indeﬁnitely.\\nOur hypothesis is that the ‘online’ RLHF policy helps us collect data on the upper end of the PM score\\ndistribution, which should improve PM calibration at high scores on subsequent iterations, and thereby allow\\nus to train even better policies. Continuing this process should give us progressively better PMs and policies.\\nNote that our use of the terminology ‘online’ is different from conventional use of the word—instead of\\ntraining the same model iteratively, we retrain a new model per iteration.\\n14In early versions of this experiment, we noticed that crowdworkers occasionally found it confusing to pick the least',\n",
       " 'We examine the inﬂuence of the amount of RLHF training for two reasons. First, RLHF [13, 57] is an\\nincreasingly popular technique for reducing harmful behaviors in large language models [3, 21, 52]. Some of\\nthese models are already deployed [52], so we believe the impact of RLHF deserves further scrutiny. Second,\\nprevious work shows that the amount of RLHF training can signiﬁcantly change metrics on a wide range of\\npersonality, political preference, and harm evaluations for a given model size [41]. As a result, it is important\\nto control for the amount of RLHF training in the analysis of our experiments.\\n3.2 Experiments\\n3.2.1 Overview\\nWe test the effect of natural language instructions on two related but distinct moral phenomena: stereotyping\\nand discrimination. Stereotyping involves the use of generalizations about groups in ways that are often\\nharmful or undesirable.4To measure stereotyping, we use two well-known stereotyping benchmarks, BBQ\\n[40] (§3.2.2) and Windogender [49] (§3.2.3). For discrimination, we focus on whether models make disparate\\ndecisions about individuals based on protected characteristics that should have no relevance to the outcome.5\\nTo measure discrimination, we construct a new benchmark to test for the impact of race in a law school course',\n",
       " 'logic here is that if a model can really ‘helpfully follow instructions’, then a prompt or explanation should\\nbe sufﬁcient to bridge the zero-to-few-shot gap. We are very far from achieving this level of performance!\\nEven on the honesty evaluation TruthfulQA [Lin et al., 2021] we close a bit less than half of this gap (Figure\\n5). We also brieﬂy investigated whether our RLHF-ﬁnetuned code models have any comparative advantage\\nwhen exposed to prompts including buggy code [Chen et al., 2021], but we did not ﬁnd any beneﬁts there.\\nOne would hope a fully aligned model would do its best to write correct code, even when given a buggy\\nprompt.\\nWe also harbor a general concern that perhaps our techniques only render models aligned ‘on the surface’,\\nand that they still harbor harmful biases or other tendencies that may surface in more subtle contexts. We\\nfound that RLHF models have a more positive sentiment towards all racial and religious groups, which seems\\npromising, but does not necessarily indicate that biases have been reduced. And with respect to gender, we\\nfound that RLHF model biases are very strongly correlated with the bias of the underlying language models.',\n",
